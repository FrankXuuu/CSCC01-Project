 **Task:**

- Introduce the team members: for each member, include a picture and a 150-word biography. A biography should describe you as a professional: think of how you would introduce yourself to a prospective employee.

# Project Deliverable 2: Project Requirement 
**Path to deliverable:** [L02_09/Deliverables/Product Backlog.pdf](https://github.com/CSCC01F17/L02_09/blob/master/Deliverables/Product%20Backlog.pdf)  
**Current Version**: v0

**Deliverable Assignment Link:** <https://thierrysans.github.io/CSCC01/work/06/>  
**Status:** Completed   
**Deliverable Mark:** not released   
**Interview Mark:** not released  


 **Task:**  
 
 The product backlog will contain two deliverables: the personas and the user stories.

- **Personas:** Personas, together, represent all future users of our software system. Study the materials provided by the client. Contact the client(s). Explore the existing software. All of the users were discussed with the team, and merged and duplicate information together
- **User stories:** The user stories, together, will reflect all the user requirements (from all prospective users). User stories are detailed enough that creating the tasks in deliverable 3 will be a simple task

These two deliverables will be labelled with their version. As these requirements evolve, the version of these documents will evolve as well.
 
 **TODO:**
 
- [x] Every member will create personas with user stories, coordinating to not have too much overlap
- [x] Team meeting to go over the entire product backlog and finalize **DATE:** 8am-10am Monday October 16, 2017
 

# Project Deliverable 3: Project Planning

 **Task:**  
 
Each sprint should have its own sprint backlog. For this deliverable, each sprint backlog should contain:
